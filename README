A quick and dirty attempt to solve the quora/twitter challenge of getting
the closest n neighbors near to a given input location. 

The algorithm can be modified to get the nearest tweets (i.e with fewer input
params).

For more details refer the first challenge in
http://www.quora.com/challenges

TO DO: 

(i) A simple GUI implemented as a single page application using the Quora/Twitter API would be awesome. 

(ii) Optimizations to the nearby algorithm remain.

Execution: java Nearby input
